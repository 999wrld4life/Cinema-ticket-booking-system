The Cinema Ticket Booking System is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for booking movie tickets. It allows users to browse through available movies, select showtimes, choose seats, and make reservations. The system also supports user authentication and provides both customers and administrators with distinct functionalities.
