current functionalities of my prototype
--1. creates an account for a new user using his first name, last name and a password

--2. generates a username for the new user using his first name, last name and numbers

--3. logs in the new user using his auto-generated username and a strong password used during 
     registration- note that this exactly follows after registration)

--4. if the user has already registered, he can log in with his username and password(
     there's an alternative path that lets the user log in if he already has an account)

--5. lists the available movies, including their rating, showtime, genre and synopsis from a movie 
     file that's populated with different movies

--6. lets the user choose the movie he wants from the listed movies(searching functionality)

--7. lets the user book a movie(if it's found) and choose his preferred seat number

--8. the user then can see his booking history, which includes his information (his username),
     the movie details and his selected seat
     
--9. Show available seats to the user 

--10. for different users booking the same movie, there should be a way to avoid booking of the
     same seat. 
     
--11. create a room class with the thought behind that the cinema has 3 rooms and each room
     broadcasts only one movie. 
     
--12. add synopsis to the movies
     
remaining functionalities that i think are very important
 --1. the program currently shows the booking history that's made during the running time of
      the app(basically only one booking history for the specific user). But assume that if a
      user makes multiple bookings multiple times, so it should be able to show the whole 
      booking history for the user
      
--2. strong authentication --almost done

--3. refactor the code to implement the DRY principle as much as possible


     
optional(fancy) functionalities
--1. implementing GUI using either Swing or javaFX (Swing is kinda easy)
